### 1.Code Movement

By moving code properly, we may reduce stalls and hazards.

### 2.Loop Unrolling

Unrolling the loop is a common way to omptimize code

To deal with hazard caused by "name dependencies", we can use "register renaming".

### 3.Software Pipeline

Software Pipeline reorganizes loops so that each iteration is made from instructions chosen from different iterations of the original loop.
If iterations from loops are independent, then can get more ILP by taking instructions from different iterations.
