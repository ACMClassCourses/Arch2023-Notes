About Memory Reorder Buffer

[Problem]Addresses out-of-order processor issues for correct instruction execution.

[Design]

Stores in-flight memory operations temporarily.
In-order Commit: Ensures committed results follow correct program order.

[Dependencies]

Tracks instruction dependencies to prevent premature commitments.

[Applications]

Enforces memory consistency models in parallel programming.
Aids correct result commitment in speculative execution scenarios.
Key component in out-of-order processors for efficient execution.
