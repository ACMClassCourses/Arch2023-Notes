## Reducing miss penalty

### Read Priority over Write on Miss

set a write buffer

Write-through: Check write buffer contents before read; if no conflicts, let the memory access continue.

Write-back:Write-back: copy the dirty block to a write buffer, then do the read, and then do the write.

### Early Restart and Critical Word First

Early restart—As soon as the requested word of the block arrives, send it to the CPU and let the CPU continue execution.

Critical Word First—Request the missed word first from memory and send it to the CPU as soon as it arrives; let the CPU continue execution while filling the rest of the words in the block. Also called wrapped fetch and requested word first.

### Non-blocking caches to reduce stalls on misses

Non-blocking cache or lockup-free cache allow data  cache to continue to supply cache hits during a miss.

### Add a second-level cache

有 $AMAT = Hit Time_{L1} + Miss Rate_{L1} x (Hit Time_{L2} + Miss Rate_{L2} + Miss Penalty_{L2})$
